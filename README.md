# Nonprofit Organization App

The nonprofit sponsors the education of children living in a small
Mexican town. As a whole, the organization is relatively large,
consisting of villagers, stores, volunteers and sponsors. To reduce
the organizational overhead, the application will digitally implement
all the features of the service that are currently being done manually.
