# Nonprofit Organization App

The non-profit (Sponsored Children Project) connects sponsors to children in need of educational aide in a small Mexican town. As a whole, the organization is relatively large, consisting of villagers, stores, volunteers, and sponsors. To reduce the organizational overhead, the application digitally implements all the features of the service that are currently being done manually.
